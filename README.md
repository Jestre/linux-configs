My linux configurations
-----------------------

This is a snapshot of various linux configurations in use by me, including my
setup for i3wm, conky, etc.

Dotfiles are prefixed with "dot-". For example, ".profile" would be checked in
as "dot-profile". While git supports dotfiles just fine, this makes things a
bit less messy when browsing the files (and it's not like this repository is
an actual mirror of ~ anyway).
