=============

My linux configurations
-----------------------

This is a snapshot of various linux configurations in use by me, including my
setup for i3wm, conky, etc.

Dotfiles are prefixed with "dot-". For example, ".profile" would be checked in
as "dot-profile". While git supports dotfiles just fine, this makes things a
bit less messy when browsing the files (and it's not like this repository is
an actual mirror of ~ anyway).

In many cases, I have different configurations for different systems, so I've
broken them out into saparate files where appropriate.

Most importantly, don't clone this and put these configurations into place
expecting them to work for you - this is a reference which I hope others find
useful.
